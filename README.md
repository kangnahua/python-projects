# python-projects
A repo for my small python projects

`youtube-downloader.py`
(2016-09-10) This is a small script for downloading YouTube videos into mp3 audio files from the terminal.
`BeautifulSoup`, `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg` are required in your OS for the script to work.
The script will provide the 19 search results from YouTube and you can type in the number of the video that you want to download.
Downloaded files will be saved in your current working directory (pwd).

`coffee-and-dinner.py`
(2016-09-15) This is a small script using `sqlite3` to record fun punishments for teammates. My current group 'Lumanajari' at SSE set up the rules for anyone who arrives late to our group meetings. If you are late for cumulative more than 15 minutes, you will buy everyone else a cup of coffee. If you are late for three times (regardless of minutes accumulated), you will invite everyone to dinner. Instead of using Excel, I wrote this little program to record late times in SQL using Python 3.
