# python-projects
A repo for my small python projects

`youtube-downloader.py`
This is a smaller script I wrote for downloading YouTube videos into mp3 audio files from the terminal.
youtube-dl and ffmpeg are required in your OS for the script to work.
The script will provide the 19 search results from YouTube and you can type in the number of the video that you want to download.
Downloaded files will be saved in your current working directory (pwd).
